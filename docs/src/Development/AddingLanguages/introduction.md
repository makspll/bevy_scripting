# Adding New Languages to BMS

If you are interested in adding a new language to BMS, please read this section first. Adding a new language is a non-trivial task depending on the language you want to add. It also requires a lot of effort and time to maintain a new language, so unless the language you want to add is widely used and has a large community, it might not be worth the effort.
